**Overview**:
This project investigates the feasibility of conducting statistical group difference tests using data generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), particularly in scenarios where real data is inaccessible. The study focuses on neuroimaging applications, analyzing cortical thickness on brain mesh surfaces in Alzheimerâ€™s disease datasets.

**Features**
* GAN-Based Data Generation: Utilizes GANs to generate synthetic graph-structured data representing cortical thickness measurements.
* Statistical Testing: Implements group difference tests to compare generated data distributions between case and control groups.
* Empirical Validation: Validates the approach using real-world neuroimaging datasets.
